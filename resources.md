<strong>Potential Impact of AI on Jobs: A View into the Telecom Industry</strong>
<br/><small><em>[AI Squared Forum](http://www.aisquaredforum.ca/), September 2019 </em></small>
<br/><small><em>It has been suggested that AI and automation will eliminate or reduce jobs. At the same time the proponents of augmented intelligence world view suggest that AI will free up employees to do more higher value jobs and tasks. In this talk I evaluate the potential impacts of AI and automation on jobs. Specifically, I explore the current jobs in the telecom industry and evaluate the impacts of AI and automation on those jobs. I then consider some employment trends in major telecom operators and conclude with some implications and calls to action.</em></small>

<strong>Autonomic Marketing: How far are we?</strong>
<br/><small><em>[TMLS Micro-Summit on Retail and Advertising](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/toronto-machine-learning-micro-summit-series-tmls-retail-and-advertising-special-focus-tickets-56919639173#), March 2019 </em></small>
<br/><small><em>In this talk, I explore the question of whether true autonomic marketing is possible. To answer this question, I provide an overview of AI applications in advertising and marketing with an emphasis on digital marketing. Specifically, I survey the applications of AI in promotions, advertisements, search, pricing and programmatic marketing. Given the current state, I then explore what might be possible in the future. Towards this, I present some of the trends in AI unocovered by Omnicom Media Group and our point of view on AI applications in advertising and retail. Finally, I conclude with some case studies of applying AI at OMG and lessons learned.</em></small>

<strong>Time series modeling of network traffic and alarms</strong>
<br/><small><em>[Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence Endless Summer School on Time Series Applications
](https://vectorinstitute.ai/), TELUS presentation, November 2018 </em></small>
<br/><small><em>In this talk, we describe two use cases where we have applied time series modeling techniques. In the network traffic forecasting use case, we describe our approach to forecasting traffic which was then used in network build planning and prioritization. In the network alarms use case, we describe an approach where we apply deviations from trend to proactively spot alarms and identify device breakdowns. In both cases, we describe some implementation challenges and conclude with lessons learned.</em></small>

<strong>Evaluating the success of conversational agents at TELUS</strong>
<br/><small><em>[Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence Endless Summer School on New Algorithms
](https://vectorinstitute.ai/), TELUS presentation, November 2017 </em></small>
<br/><small><em>In this talk, we will present the results of the evaluation of business success of conversational agents at TELUS. Noting the two sides of conversational AI, namely the task-completion or productivity side and the emotional side, we present the evaluations from deploying multiple conversational agents across brands and different lines of business at TELUS. Our study emphasizes the importance of multidimensional evaluation of commercial deployment of conversational agents. Our evaluations also provide insight into the next generation of conversational agents, namely agents that generate context-sensitive responses, and the opportunities with deep learning based chatbots. We also outline TELUS's overall chatbot strategy as part of the end to end customer experience and our vision for AI.</em></small>
