<p>This blog is about strategic analytics and AI. So I thought I would start off by writing the first article about that.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What is strategic analytics?</h2>

<p>The term strategic analytics has been around since at least 2008 although the work in this area goes back several decades. Strategic analytics refers to the application of mathematical and analytical techniques including statistical analysis to answer questions that are of strategic value to the business. This includes enabling decisions in areas such as revenue management, product development, competitive positioning, cost efficiency and profitability.</p>

<p>Levin and Mcgill suggest that strategic analytics encompasses analytics utilized to answering two types of questions – one-off analyses to answer big questions such as strategic alliances, partnerships and M&A or the automated analysis of numerous small decisions such as inventory control and pricing, promotions etc.</p>

<p>Strategic analytics would also include the analysis of data to support strategy based on frameworks such as industry analysis, five forces analysis, value chain analysis or resources and capabilities analysis. Another identifier of strategic analytics is the use of data to evaluate high level financial metrics for an organization such as an NPV analysis or free cash flow analysis. Other such analysis to evaluate investments based on metrics such as return on investment (ROI) or return on ad spend (ROAS) also constitute strategic analytics.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What are the tools and techniques for strategic analytics?</h2>

<p>The most common tool for strategic analytics remains Microsoft Excel. However, tools including Python, R and SAS are also being increasingly used. A wide range of techniques are used in strategic analytics including statistical analysis, predictive modeling and machine learning, forecasting, optimization, simulation and scenario planning. Here is a brief description of each of these techniques:</p>

  <li><b>Statistical analysis</b>- an important part of strategic analytics remains some basic descriptive analytics and exploratory data analysis. Techniques including averaging, bivariate analysis or cross-tab, correlations are essential for understanding the characteristics of some of the variables involved.</li>
  <li><b>Predictive modeling and machine learning</b>– techniques including classification and regression which fall under this category are essential for strategic analytics. Problems such as churn or upsell prediction, delinquency in loans prediction, fraud detection, acquisition and cross-sell are cases for classification techniques. Problems including investment level prediction, ad spend prediction, inventory level prediction etc where the predicted quantity is continuous are cases for regression techniques. In most cases, such predictions are incorporated in and investment or cost analysis equation with trade-offs to answer a strategic question.</li>
  <li><b>Forecasting</b>– predictions involving time series measures generally fall under this category. For instance, predicting the data usage in a telecommunications company by month, week or day involves a time series. Other forecasting problems include forecasting calls to the call center, forecasting churn numbers or acquisition numbers or investment levels or profits on a monthly or some other periodic manner. Such forecasts could also be used along with optimization and scenario planning methods to answer a strategic question.</li>
</ul>
<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
